# T-Enhanced
Enhancements for you favourite stock management system - Tesseract

## Synopsis

T-Enhanced has gone by many names but this I yet again intend to stick to; it's simple and easy to say.
The program is made for a very small group of people using a stock management system called Tesseract.
Unfortuanately because of the nature of the Tesseract it will only work for the version that it's made for. Also given the way that it interafces with Tesseract using COM creates another restriction as to why it will only work in this one area.
Never the less, feel free to take a look through or whatever, you may find something useful.

## Motivation

I wrote this mainly for myself to begin with, as it used to take an obscene amount of clicks and navigating to do the simplest thing on Tesseract. I personaly got sick of it and decided to do something about it.

## Installation
The only things needed for this T-Enhanced to work are
- [Autohotkey](http://ahkscript.org/download/ahk-install.exe)
- [Dymo Label v.8](http://www.dymo.com/en-US/dymo-label-software-v8-5-windows)
- Dymo Printer
- Internet Explorer (tested on IE 10 Only)
Other than that download & unzip. Either run Tesseract Zoanthropy.ahk (name change pending)
